# California House Price Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning system to predict house prices in California. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation using Python. Various steps such as checking for null values, performing correlation analysis, creating a heatmap, and visualizing actual vs. predicted prices using a scatter plot are included.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Import and Exploration
- The California house prices dataset is imported into the Python environment.
- Initial data exploration is performed to understand the dataset's structure and contents, including summary statistics and distributions.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Checking for Null Values**: The dataset is checked for any missing values, and appropriate steps are taken to handle them.
- **Feature Engineering**: Relevant features are selected and transformed as needed for the model.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Correlation Analysis**: A correlation matrix is computed to understand the relationships between different features.
- **Heatmap**: A heatmap is created to visually represent the correlation matrix, highlighting strong correlations.
- **Scatter Plot**: A scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between actual house prices and predicted house prices.

### 4. Model Building
- A machine learning model is built using appropriate algorithms to predict house prices.
- The model is trained using the training data and its parameters are tuned for optimal performance.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- The trained model is evaluated using the testing data.
- Key performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared are calculated to assess the model's accuracy.

### 6. Visualization
- A scatter plot is created to compare actual house prices with predicted prices, providing a visual assessment of the model's performance.

### 7. Conclusion
- Insights and conclusions based on the model's performance are summarized.
- Potential improvements and future work are discussed to enhance the model's accuracy and reliability.

## Dataset

- **California House Prices Dataset**: Contains various features related to house prices in California, including location, size, and other relevant attributes.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in predicting house prices using the California house prices dataset. By following the outlined workflow, one can build, evaluate, and enhance a regression model in Python to effectively predict house prices.
